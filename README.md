# ⚡ Bitcoin Is the Electrons: A Capital Stack Rewired Through Engineering

> “If Bitcoin is electricity, it's not the voltage—it's the electrons. The real energy. The signal.”

When we talk about Bitcoin, we reach for metaphors to describe something fundamentally new. Michael Saylor gave us one of the best:

> *“Bitcoin is a swarm of cyber hornets serving the goddess of wisdom, feeding on the fire of truth…”*

It’s vivid, primal, and poetic.

But let’s take it further. Let’s wire Bitcoin into an engineering framework — not just as a digital gold metaphor, but as an **electrical system**. Because when you look closely, Bitcoin doesn't behave like an asset. It behaves like **energy** — and the capital stack around it? That’s the circuit.

## 🛠️ Final Thoughts

This isn’t just an analogy. It’s a design language.  

As more capital flows into Bitcoin, we’ll see structured financial products evolve like **custom chips** — optimized to handle different aspects of the Bitcoin signal. Some will amplify it. Some will buffer it. Some will reshape entire institutions around it.

And if Bitcoin is the new electricity, then MicroStrategy’s capital stack is the **first modular load balancer** built for it.
