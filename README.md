# ‚ö° Bitcoin Is the Electrons: A Capital Stack Rewired Through Engineering

> ‚ÄúIf Bitcoin is electricity, it's not the voltage‚Äîit's the electrons. The real energy. The signal.‚Äù

When we talk about Bitcoin, we reach for metaphors to describe something fundamentally new. Michael Saylor gave us one of the best:

> *‚ÄúBitcoin is a swarm of cyber hornets serving the goddess of wisdom, feeding on the fire of truth‚Ä¶‚Äù*

It‚Äôs vivid, primal, and poetic.

But let‚Äôs take it further. Let‚Äôs wire Bitcoin into an engineering framework ‚Äî not just as a digital gold metaphor, but as an **electrical system**. Because when you look closely, Bitcoin doesn't behave like an asset. It behaves like **energy** ‚Äî and the capital stack around it? That‚Äôs the circuit.

## üõ†Ô∏è Final Thoughts

This isn‚Äôt just an analogy. It‚Äôs a design language.  

As more capital flows into Bitcoin, we‚Äôll see structured financial products evolve like **custom chips** ‚Äî optimized to handle different aspects of the Bitcoin signal. Some will amplify it. Some will buffer it. Some will reshape entire institutions around it.

And if Bitcoin is the new electricity, then MicroStrategy‚Äôs capital stack is the **first modular load balancer** built for it.
